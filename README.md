# IrctcSystemWithAdmin
This is the IRCTC Site System which is made with Php,Html,CSS and JavaScript.
It is a very basic website performing the ticket booking and cancelling operations.
But it also has the edit profile feature in which one can easily change the id,phone number and also the photograph.
Can even update and delete the profile picture.
You must have the xampp,or wampp control panel in your particular system to work out with it. Also the sql file needs to be uploaded to the mysql
Client in the phpmyadmin before starting with the login or registration process.
The Admin Panel is Also available in the system. You just need to type the admin.html to access it. The default userid and password you can find after importing the sql file to your phpmyadmin.
The Google API is not working yet but the working is underprocess so just for a reference the file is present in it. You can delete it if you want to as it has no use yet.
